# very_efficient_fizzbuzz
The most efficient solution to fizzbuzz I could think of.

Hihgly modulable: modify a short dictionary and add your own twist on fizzbuzz! I also compare my method with a standard one found on hacker rank (link in my code). Comparisons include run time and memory allocation. Check out those efficiency results! All my numbers are bigger!!!

Feel free to reach out if you have any ideas to increase efficiency.
